As part of a group assignment in CompSci345 (Human Computer Interaction) at University of Auckland, my group and I were tasked in creating a high-fidelity prototype for a file sharing service using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. We were to demonstrate our knowledge of usage testing and design principles (Balance, Unity, Emphasis, Colour, Gestalt).

Currently, the code only has one functionality (that is not fully functional) that is implemented to demonstrate what the prototype should do. 

This functionality is the ability to share multiple files to multiple people within one interaction.

This group project resulted in a final grade of **A** (8.65/10).
